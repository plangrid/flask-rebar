Changelog
=========

Version 1.0.0
-------------

* Renamed ``marshal_schemas`` parameter to ``marshal_schema``. While the marshal schema parameter is a bit more complex since it can also receive a dictionary, keeping it singular is more consistent with the other parameters. Note that this is a breaking change since 0.1.0.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

Initial release!
