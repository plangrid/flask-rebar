v1.11.0 (2019-10-28)
--------------------
- Improve swagger support for authenticators (#130) (BP-778. [Andrew
  Standley]

  * Added a get_open_api_version method to the swagger generator interface to help with refactoring the swagger tests so that we can use generators that have customer converters registered.

  * Updated jsonschema library for tests.

  * Added failing tests for swagger generation from Authenticators.

  * Added tests for the interface of AuthenticatorConverter to make sure I don't accidentally change it.

  * Added authenticator to swagger conversion framework.

  * Updated the multiple_authenticators test to use the new auth converter framework.

  * Fixed eol_version for a deprecation message, and caught warnings on the legacy AuthenticatorConverter test.

  * Fix typos and imports.

  * Added documentation to AuthenticatorConverter. Also noted potential issue with conflicting scheme names in generators, going to push addressing that to later.

  * Added combined authentication examples to the recipes doc.


v1.10.2 (2019-09-19)
--------------------

Fix
~~~
- Update authenticators to catch Forbidden exception (#133) [Marc-Éric]


v1.10.1 (2019-09-19)
--------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Tweaking build rules, updating docs, and prepping for bumpversion do-
  over. [Rick Riensche]

Fix
~~~
- Treat "description" key the same way as "explode" key for query and h…
  (#129) [Artem Revenko]

Other
~~~~~
- Accept bare class for schema arguments (#126) [Rick Riensche]
- Fix marshmallow test helpers so that they work will all unittest
  compatible frameworks and not just pytest. 'python setup.py test'
  works again. (#127) [Andrew Standley]


v1.10.0 (2019-09-11)
--------------------
- BP-763: Add support for multiple authenticators (#122) [Andrew
  Standley]

  * Added the ability to specify a conversion function for deprecated params.

  * Added support for defining authentication with a list of Authenticators; None, a single Authenticator, and USE_DEFAULT(where applicable) are still valid values. The authenticator parameter becomes authenticators; authenticator is still usable until 3.0 via the deprecation wrappers. The default_authenticator parameter becomes default_authenticators; default_authenticator is still usable until 3.0 via the deprecation wrappers. This change affects PathDefinition, HandlerRegistry, Rebar, SwaggerGeneratorI, SwaggerV2Generator, and SwaggerV3Generator. Note: It's an open question how best to handle returning the errors when all authenticators fail. For now we are returning the first error with the assumption that the first authenticator is the 'preferred' one; this also preserves the previous behaviour.

  * Updated docs.
- [FEATURE] adding too many requests error (#120) [Fabian]


v1.9.1 (2019-08-20)
-------------------

Fix
~~~
- 118 - pinned to an incompatible version of Marshmallow (3.0.0) [Rick Riensche]

  * Changes between 3.0.0rc5 and the actual release of 3.0.0 made our presumptive compatibility changes no longer sufficient

- Relax overly-sensitive test (#117) [Rick Riensche]

  * Deals with a subtle change in returned data on "Invalid input type" schema validation error between marshmallow 2.19 and 2.20. In return from Schema.load, "data" changed from empty dictionary to None, and we had an overzealous test that was expecting empty dictionary; whereas the value of "data" in this scenario appears to be undefined.
