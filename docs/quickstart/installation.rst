Installation
------------

Flask-Rebar can be installed with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install flask-rebar

Flask-Rebar depends on Flask and Marshmallow. Flask has `fantastic documentation <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/latest/installation/>`_ on setting up a development environment for Python, so if you're new to this sort of thing, check that out.
